# Gemini Pro

Simple webview app that gives you a little bit more functionality

# How to use

You need to give a permission to your google drive using chrome first, and then you can use the app.

This is google security policy and i can't fix it. And also this security policy is the same reason downloads don't work in the app except for audio downloading, generated video you can save on your google drive.
